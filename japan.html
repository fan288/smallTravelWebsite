                        Japan is an island nation located in East Asia, situated in the Pacific Ocean. 
                        It consists of four main islands—Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, and Shikoku—along 
                        with many smaller islands. Japan lies to the east of the Asian continent, 
                        separated by the Sea of Japan, and is northeast of China and Korea. The country 
                        is known for its unique blend of traditional culture and modern technology, 
                        as well as its stunning landscapes, from mountains to coastlines.

            <p>From the ancient Jomon people to the flourishing Heian period, where art and literature thrived, 
                Japan has evolved significantly over time. The samurai era brought feudalism and the 
                rise of shogunates, followed by the Edo period, which saw peace and cultural growth.

                The Meiji Restoration in 1868 marked a major turning point, as Japan embraced modernization 
                and became a global power. After World War II, the country rebuilt itself, emerging as a 
                leader in technology and innovation. Today, Japan's history is reflected in its stunning 
                temples, traditional festivals, and vibrant culture, offering a unique blend of past and present.
                Here is the video to introduce the modern history of Japan:

                        Japanese culture is a rich tapestry woven from centuries of history, tradition, and innovation. 
                        One of the most notable aspects is the deep respect for nature, reflected in various cultural practices, 
                        such as bonsai and the celebration of seasonal festivals like hanami, where people gather to appreciate 
                        the fleeting beauty of cherry blossoms. Traditional Japanese architecture, with its sliding doors and 
                        tatami mat floors, harmonizes with the surrounding landscape, creating serene spaces that invite contemplation.

                        <br><br>
                        Another significant element of Japanese culture is its emphasis on etiquette and social harmony. 
                        Manners play a crucial role in daily life, influencing everything from communication styles to 
                        dining practices. The concept of "wa" (和), which means harmony, underscores the importance of 
                        group cohesion and respect for others. This is seen in practices such as bowing as a form of 
                        greeting and the meticulous preparation of tea during the traditional tea ceremony, known as 
                        "chanoyu." Japanese cuisine, with dishes like sushi, ramen, and tempura, emphasizes seasonal 
                        ingredients and aesthetic presentation, showcasing the artistry that permeates Japanese life.

                        <br><br>
                        Additionally, Japan is renowned for its artistic expressions, ranging from traditional forms like 
                        calligraphy and ikebana (flower arranging) to contemporary pop culture phenomena such as anime and 
                        manga. Iconic artworks, like those of ukiyo-e woodblock prints, depict scenes of everyday life and 
                        nature, while modern art movements continue to thrive. Festivals, such as Gion Matsuri in Kyoto, 
                        celebrate local traditions through elaborate floats and traditional costumes. This dynamic interplay 
                        of historical traditions and modern influences continues to shape Japan's cultural identity on the 
                        global stage.

                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagoya_Castle" target="_blank">Nagoya Castle</a> 
                (名古屋城, Nagoyajō) was built in the beginning of the Edo Period (1603-1868) as 
                the seat of one of the three branches of the ruling Tokugawa family, the Owari branch. 
                As such, it was one of the largest castles in the country, and the castle town around 
                it ultimately grew to become Japan's fourth largest city.

                <br><br>
                Most castle buildings were destroyed in the air raids of 1945, including the castle keep 
                and the palace buildings. The current ferro-concrete reconstruction of the castle keep 
                dates from 1959 and - before its closure in May 2018 - contained a museum about the 
                castle's history. The park surrounding the castle keep features two circles of moats 
                and impressive walls with corner turrets. It becomes an attractive hanami spot during 
                the cherry blossom season which usually peaks in late March or early April.
            </p>

                <img src="./res/japan/attractionNagoyaCastle2.jpg" alt="Nagoya Castle 2" />
            </div>

            <p>
                The castle's palace (Honmaru Goten) was recently rebuilt and fully opened to the public 
                in June 2018. Half a century after its destruction in the war, the palace was rebuilt 
                using traditional construction materials and techniques. It contains entrance and 
                reception halls as well as rooms reserved for the visiting shogun with beautiful, 
                replicated paintings on the sliding doors (fusuma). The palace has been considered 
                one of the finest examples of Shoin architecture in all of Japan.

                <br><br>
                In another ambitious project, the city is planning to reconstruct Nagoya Castle's 
                main keep in wood. The current, ferro-concrete main keep was closed to the public 
                in May 2018 due to concerns about its earthquake resistance. It was previously 
                schedule to be demolished in 2024 and the new, wooden keep to be completed in 2028; 
                however, the project is being delayed and not expected to be completed before 2032.

            <p class="attraction-sub-header"><b>Getting There and Around</b></p>

            <p>From Nagoya Station, take the Sakuradori Subway Line to Hisayaodori Station 
                (5 minutes) and change to the Meijo Subway Line to Nagoyajo Station (2 minutes). 
                The total one way journey takes about ten minutes and costs 240 yen. From the 
                nearest exit, it is a three minute walk to the castle's east gate.

                <br><br>
                Alternatively, the castle's main gate can be reached from Nagoya Station by the 
                Meguru tourist loop bus in about 25 minutes. The fare is 210 yen per ride or 
                500 yen for a day pass.
