                        South Korea, officially known as the Republic of Korea, is located in East Asia 
                        on the southern part of the Korean Peninsula. It is bordered by North Korea to 
                        the north, while to the south, it faces the Yellow Sea. The country is flanked 
                        by the Korea Strait to the east and the Yellow Sea to the west. South Korea 
                        shares maritime borders with Japan to the southeast, making it a significant 
                        hub in the region. Its geographical position has contributed to its rich cultural 
                        heritage and economic development, as it serves as a crossroads between various 
                        Asian nations.

            <h3>History</h3>

            <p>South Korea's history is marked by a rich tapestry of dynasties, invasions, and cultural 
                evolution. The earliest known kingdom, Gojoseon, emerged around 2333 BCE. Over the centuries, 
                various dynasties, such as the Silla, Goryeo, and Joseon, played significant roles in shaping 
                the region's identity. The Joseon Dynasty, which lasted for over five centuries, is particularly 
                notable for its advancements in Confucianism, science, and the arts. The invention of the Korean 
                script, Hangul, in the 15th century by King Sejong the Great is a pivotal moment in Korean history, 
                promoting literacy and cultural cohesion.

                        The 20th century brought profound changes, including Japanese colonization from 1910 to 1945, 
                        which significantly impacted Korean society and culture. Following Japan's defeat in World War II, 
                        Korea was divided into two separate states—the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) 
                        and the Republic of Korea (South Korea). The Korean War (1950-1953) solidified this division, 
                        leading to ongoing political tensions and differing paths of development, with South Korea emerging 
                        as a democratic and economically prosperous nation.

                        South Korean culture is a vibrant blend of traditional and modern influences, characterized 
                        by its unique customs, cuisine, and artistic expressions. Traditional elements, such as hanbok 
                        (traditional clothing), tea ceremonies, and folk music, coexist with contemporary trends like
                        K-pop, fashion, and digital media. The global phenomenon of K-pop has not only transformed 
                        the music industry but also influenced fashion and youth culture worldwide, with groups like 
                        BTS and BLACKPINK leading the charge.

                        <br><br>
                        Cuisine is another vital aspect of South Korean culture, renowned for its bold flavors and 
                        diverse dishes. Staples like kimchi, a fermented vegetable dish, and bibimbap, a mixed rice 
                        dish, showcase the emphasis on fresh ingredients and communal dining. Festivals, such as 
                        Chuseok (harvest festival) and Seollal (Lunar New Year), highlight the importance of family 
                        and community, featuring traditional games, food, and rituals that honor ancestors. This 
                        rich cultural heritage continues to evolve, reflecting South Korea's dynamic society.

                The N Seoul Tower (Korean: N 서울타워), officially the YTN Seoul Tower and a.k.a. the 
                Namsan Tower, is a communication and observation tower located on the summit of Namsan 
                (262 m (860 ft)) in central Seoul, South Korea. The 236-metre-tall (774 ft) structure 
                marks the second highest point in Seoul and is considered a local landmark.

                <br><br>
                Built in 1971, N Seoul Tower is South Korea's first general radio wave tower, providing 
                TV and radio broadcasting in Seoul. Currently, the tower broadcasts signals for Korean 
                media outlets, such as KBS, MBC and SBS.

            </div>

            <p>
                The main draw of N Seoul Tower is its observatory. Observe the city below from the height 
                of the clouds by making your way up to the tower’s observation deck. The main observation 
                deck on 3F features large, floor-to-ceiling windows the whole way around the tower, allowing 
                you to experience the full 360-degree views. There is information on various points of interests 
                that can be seen through the windows and plenty of comfy chairs around as well. One floor up 
                from here, on 4F, you’ll find the digital observatory. This floor features high-powered 
                telescopes and each window panel lets you know which major world city you are facing.

                <br><br>
                The N Seoul Tower observatory is open year-round from 10 a.m. to 11 pm Sunday to Friday and 
                from 10 a.m. to midnight on Saturdays. However, entry up to the observatory closes half an 
                hour before closing time, so make sure you arrive before then. Access to the observatory 
                also requires an admission ticket. The price of admission is 10,000 won for visitors 13 
                years of age and 8,000 won for children between three and 12 and seniors over 65.

                The center is open from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Tickets cost 4,000 won for guests 14 years and
